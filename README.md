## üõ†Ô∏è **Your Apps for Cybersecurity Mastery**:

### 1. **Oxsecure Intelligence**  
Oxsecure Intelligence is your gateway to an expansive repository of cybersecurity knowledge. It offers **in-depth information** on a wide range of topics and secure coding practices aimed at vulnerability prevention. This tool features three key modules:

- **Oxsecure Chat**: An interactive chatbot that answers any cybersecurity-related query with detailed insights.
- **Image Analysis**: Powered by **Gemini multimodal**, this module analyzes images and generates contextual information based on the image content, accompanied by input prompts.
- **File Analysis**: Integrating **VirusTotal API**, this feature analyzes files by extracting hash values and metadata. It scans the file using VirusTotal and visualizes the results through graphs generated by the **Seaborn library**, making complex data easy to understand.

### 2. **OxRAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
OxRAG takes file analysis to the next level by providing deep insights into various file types such as PDFs, URLs, text logs, and images. With **Gemini** at the heart, it goes beyond basic text extraction by embedding text into a **FAISS vector database**. Key features include:

- **Text Extraction & Embedding**: Text extracted from files is stored in a FAISS vector database, indexed via **NumPy** for rapid access.
- **Generative Q&A**: Leverage Gemini's advanced capabilities to ask questions based on the file content, retrieving highly relevant answers.
- **Text-to-Speech & Voice Recognition**: OxRAG includes **TTS** for audio responses and **speech recognition** for hands-free interaction, allowing users to engage with the system through voice commands.  

### 3. **OxImaGen**  
A powerful image analysis tool, **OxImaGen** integrates **Google Gemini** and **Hugging Face APIs** for advanced image content generation and analysis. It analyzes images, recognizes objects, and generates contextual stories or insights tailored to each image. With real-time processing and detailed content generation, **OxImaGen** transforms images into narratives, making it invaluable for creative and analytical tasks.
